About **apitrace**
==================

**apitrace** consists of a set of tools to:

* trace OpenGL, Direct3D, and DirectDraw APIs calls to a file;

* replay OpenGL and Direct3D calls from a file;

* inspect OpenGL and Direct3D state at any call while retracing;

* visualize and edit trace files.

See the [apitrace homepage](https://apitrace.github.io/) for more details.


Status
======

TL;DR: Apitrace is still being maintained, but the maintainer has very little
time to work on it, so patches/issues/requests are addressed if/as time permits.
